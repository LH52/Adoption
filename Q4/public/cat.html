                   <h2>Taking care of your cat</h2>
                   <h3>Groom your cat regularly</h3>
                   <p>You might be thinking, “but don't cats groom themselves?” While cats are known for their cleanliness, some extra help from you can take their health and hygiene to the next level! Short-haired, medium-haired and long-haired cats can all benefit from regular brushing. This helps remove loose hair from the coat, preventing shedding and hairballs. In addition to practical benefits, regular grooming can be a wonderful way to bond with your cat!</p><br>
                   <h3>Provide fresh water 24/7</h3>
                   <p>Just as it is for us, drinking enough water is essential for our cats' health. Proper hydration can keep your cat comfortable and happy by helping to prevent common cat health issues like urinary tract infections and kidney disease. Many cats are picky about the water they drink. If you've ever caught your cat sipping from the sink or pawing at her water bowl, chances are she prefers moving water. This is a common and natural preference among cats! You can give your cat the fresh, flowing water she prefers and encourage her to drink, boosting her hydration, with a pet fountain.</p><br>
                   <h3>Make sure your cat always has a place to potty</h3>
                   <p>Should you have more than one litter box? Maybe! A general rule of thumb is to provide one for each cat in your home, plus one more. So, ideally, if you have two cats, you should have three litter boxes. This way, there's always an alternative available in case your cat doesn't feel like using her usual box for some reason. Speaking of which, be mindful of where you place a litter box. Make sure it's somewhere that your cat can always access, and where she'll feel comfortable letting her guard down when nature calls.</p>
                   <h3>Keep the litter box clean</h3>
                   <p>No one likes a dirty restroom. Many cats will find another place to go (like the carpet... or your pillow) if their litter box hasn't been cleaned in a while. With a traditional litter box, you should try to scoop at least once daily and clean the entire box at least once a week. If you're not a fan of scooping poop (who is?), a self-cleaning litter box is a life-changer, saving you from the stinky chore while giving your cat the consistently clean litter box she deserves. If you do notice your cat is suddenly going outside the litter box, especially when it's clean, check with your vet – this can sometimes be a sign of medical issues.</p>
